# Parallax Workflows

AI-powered equity research workflows for [Parallax](https://chicago.global/parallax), built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

**Who this is for:**
- **Fund managers** — morning briefs, scenario analysis, rebalancing decisions
- **Relationship managers (RMs)** — client meeting prep, portfolio reviews with talk tracks
- **Research analysts** — due diligence, peer comparison, earnings forensics
- **Wealth advisors** — portfolio health checks, plain-language recommendations for clients
- **Individual investors** — quick stock evaluations, thematic screening, watchlist monitoring

Run commands like `/parallax-should-i-buy AAPL` or `/parallax-client-review [holdings]` and get a structured research report. Each workflow orchestrates Parallax MCP tools in parallel — company data, factor scores, macro analysis, news — so you get comprehensive output from a single command.

## Prerequisites

These workflows require an active Parallax subscription from [Chicago Global Capital](https://chicago.global). API credentials and MCP connection details are provided to clients upon onboarding. If you are not yet a client, contact us at [chicago.global](https://chicago.global) to get started.

## Setup

### 1. Connect the Parallax MCP server

Add the Parallax MCP server to Claude Code. Connection details are provided during client onboarding. The server should appear as `claude_ai_Parallax` in your MCP configuration.

### 2. Install the workflows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bencharoenwong/parallax-workflows.git
cd parallax-workflows
./install.sh
```

This copies all workflows and shared conventions into `~/.claude/skills/`. Restart Claude Code after installing.

To install a single workflow:
```bash
cp -r skills/should-i-buy ~/.claude/skills/parallax-should-i-buy
cp -r skills/_parallax ~/.claude/skills/_parallax
```

The `_parallax` directory contains shared conventions, token-cost reference, and the AI-profiles framework (required by the `AI-*` skills). Always copy it alongside any individual workflow.

### 3. Verify

```
/parallax-should-i-buy AAPL
```

If you see "tool not found" errors, the MCP server is not connected.

## Workflows

### Concierge

| Command | What it does |

### Parallax AI Investor Profiles

A family of standalone skills that apply famous investors' workflow shapes (not just rubric thresholds) to current Parallax data, each anchored in published academic or biographical sources. Output is third-person ("Buffett-style"), always cites the source, and uses only public information.

| Command | Workflow | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `/parallax-AI-buffett <ticker>` | Bottom-up single-stock; Quality + Value + Defensive factor profile | Frazzini-Kabiller-Pedersen (2018), *FAJ*; reconciled for 21st-century intangibles via Lev-Srivastava (2022) |
| `/parallax-AI-greenblatt [ticker]` | Magic Formula: ROC + earnings yield → top-decile basket | Greenblatt (2006); Gray-Carlisle (2012) |
| `/parallax-AI-klarman <ticker>` | Balance-sheet-first margin-of-safety checks (incl. "no position warranted; cash is valid") | Klarman, *Margin of Safety* (1991) |
| `/parallax-AI-soros [ticker]` | Top-down macro → regime themes → dual-channel ticker exposure | Soros, *Alchemy of Finance* (1987); Drobny (2006) |
| `/parallax-AI-consensus <ticker or basket>` | Runs all 4 profiles in parallel; surfaces super-majority + factor-level agreement | Meta-skill |

**Framing and legal posture:**
- All profiles framed in third person ("Buffett-style," never "Buffett says")
- Each output cites its academic/book source and includes a mandatory non-advice disclaimer
- AI-inferred from publicly available information only — no proprietary endpoints
- Not financial advice, not personalized, not endorsed by any named investor
- See `skills/_parallax/AI-profiles/README.md` for inclusion criteria, v2 candidates, and design rationale

### Symbol Format

Symbols use Reuters Instrument Code (RIC) format. `/parallax-should-i-buy` auto-resolves plain tickers (AAPL); other workflows require RIC format (AAPL.O).

| Exchange | Suffix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| NASDAQ | `.O` | AAPL.O |
| NYSE | `.N` | JPM.N |
| Tokyo | `.T` | 7203.T |
| Hong Kong | `.HK` | 0700.HK |
| London | `.L` | SHEL.L |
| Singapore | `.SI` | D05.SI |

Full exchange table in `skills/_parallax/parallax-conventions.md`.

## Token Costs

Each Parallax API call consumes tokens. Quick reference:

| Workflow type | Typical tokens | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Quick stock check | 2–24 | `/parallax-should-i-buy` ~24 |
| Deep analysis | 31–45 | `/parallax-due-diligence` ~31 |
| Portfolio (10 holdings) | 36–105 | `/parallax-portfolio-checkup` ~36 |

```

Each `SKILL.md` is a self-contained instruction set. Claude reads it when you invoke the command, then orchestrates the Parallax MCP tools accordingly. No code execution — just structured API orchestration.

## Known Limitations

- **Publicly traded equities only** — no mutual funds, ETFs, or private assets
- **RIC format required** for most workflows (except `/parallax-should-i-buy`)
- **`build_stock_universe` uses keyword matching** — use sector-level queries ("US large cap consumer staples"), not abstract concepts ("pricing power in stagflation")
- **Peer groups are industry-based** — mega-caps may be compared to smaller industry peers
- **`check_macro_health` costs 5 tokens** — known issue, fix planned
